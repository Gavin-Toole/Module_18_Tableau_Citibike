2022 analysis for citibike ride data for New York.  This analysis focused on popular starting and ending ride stations.  Of note there are several ending stations with only 1 point of data.  At this point we have not been able to determine the validity of why this is occurring.  An analysis showed that most of these points are not in the starting point data.

A map is provided with 2018 population data underlying the Starting location of rides.  The size and colour of the points are based on the number of riders and can be filtered by month and hour.

A comparison of the popular starting times was performed based on months, day of the week, day of the month and hour.  The most popular times were:
Months: June to October
Day of Week: Wednesday to Saturday
Day of the Month: all similar
Hour of the Day: 4:00 pm to 7:00 pm
There were a couple unpopular days of the month and hours:
Day of Month: the 31st was the most unpopular day like due to not all months having 31 days
Hour of the Day: 2:00 am to 5:00 am, this might be an opportunity for maintenance or system upgrades

The rider type and bike type were analyzed along with the total and average ride time.  Most riders are members at 66% of the rides and most bike types used are the classic bike at 70%.

The docked bikes on average have a higher average ride time compared to both the classic and electric bikes.  Of note is the docked bike had an average ride time in December of 336 minutes compare to ~20 minutes for the classic and electric bike.  A further analysis of the data would be required to determine if this is just an anomaly in the data.
